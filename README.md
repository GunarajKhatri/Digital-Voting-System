# Digital Voting System

This is the small C project (did as a 1st sem project of C) which simulates the voting system of Nepal but in digital way.Regarding the mechanism of this project,voting to candidates and voter as well as candidate registration both things will be in different time intervals.Firstly, as program starts time will be begin for user and candidate registration and as registration time ends voting door will be opened and voter can votes to candidates of his/her respective place and can see result after the end of voting.

Registration and Voting duration time can be modifiable by changing value of varibale `int voting_start` & `int voting_end` present in program.
